# RecommenderEngine

In the attached Jupyter notebook, I built two basic models for recommending movie ratings:

**Collaborative Filtering**

The model is able produce user and item-based recommendations. I built the model in a way that it takes into account user bias and number of co-rated items.

**Matrix Factorization**

Basic factorization by SVD. The model was enhanced by integrating local and global biases of users and ratings.
